## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

I learned about HSL (Hue, Saturation, Lightness) format and also learned
how to determine the direction of a flex container.

```css
.proud-of-this-css {
  display: flex;
  flex-direction: column;
  background-color: hsl(0, 0%, 100%);
}
```

```
